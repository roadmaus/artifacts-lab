Performance Benefits: Faster and more reliable than higher-layer protocols. Network Impact: Managing broadcast traffic and ARP cache implications. Security Considerations: Detecting and handling ARP spoofing attempts. Implementation Details: Using --send-ip to force IP-based ping instead of ARP. Best Practices: Balancing speed with network impact. Use Cases: Local network mapping, rogue host detection.",
