            "NMAP classifies ports into six distinct states, each providing crucial information about target services. Open State: Indicates an application is actively accepting connections. Key Indicators: Receipt of SYN-ACK for TCP, specific UDP responses. Security Implications: Open ports represent potential attack vectors and require thorough documentation. False Positive Analysis: Understanding service behavior patterns to validate open state accuracy. Response Validation: Using multiple scan types to confirm port status. Real-world Application: Identifying unnecessary exposed services and policy violations.",
            "Closed and Filtered states provide valuable intelligence about network security posture. Closed State: Port actively refuses connections, indicates awareness of scan. Technical Indicators: RST packets for TCP, ICMP port unreachable for UDP. Filtered State: Unable to determine port status due to filtering. Detection Methods: Timeout behaviors, ICMP error messages, TCP RST patterns. Security Controls: Identifying firewall rules, packet filtering, and access controls. Best Practices: Using timing options and retransmission settings to improve accuracy.",
            "Advanced port states require sophisticated interpretation and analysis techniques. Open|Filtered State: Cannot determine if port is open or filtered. Common Causes: Packet loss, rate limiting, application-layer filtering. Unfiltered State: Port is accessible but state cannot be determined. Analysis Methods: Combining different scan types for verification. Special Considerations: Handling intermittent responses and state changes. Documentation Requirements: Noting environmental factors affecting scan results."

Protocol Specification: Targeting TCP, UDP, SCTP ports separately. Service-Based Selection: Using -sV with port ranges for service validation. Exclusion Techniques: Skipping specific ports or ranges (--exclude-ports). State-Based Targeting: Scanning based on previous scan results. Resource Optimization: Balancing comprehensive coverage with time constraints.",

        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "An 'open|filtered' state typically occurs when NMAP receives no response from a probe. This could mean either the port is open but packets are being dropped, or a firewall is filtering the port."
