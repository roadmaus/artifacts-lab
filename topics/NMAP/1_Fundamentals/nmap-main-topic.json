      {
        "id": 1,
        "type": "multiple-choice",
        "question": "Which scan type would be most appropriate for a stealth scan of a production server during business hours?",
        "options": [
          "TCP Connect scan with maximum speed (-sT -T5)",
          "SYN scan with paranoid timing (-sS -T0)",
          "UDP scan with normal timing (-sU -T3)",
          "XMAS scan with aggressive timing (-sX -T4)"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "A SYN scan with paranoid timing (-sS -T0) offers the best balance of stealth and reliability. The paranoid timing prevents overwhelming production services, while SYN scanning remains less detectable than full TCP connects."
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "type": "multiple-choice",
        "question": "A network scan shows several ports in 'filtered' state. What is the most effective next step?",
        "options": [
          "Switch to TCP Connect scanning",
          "Increase the timing template",
          "Use ACK scanning to probe firewall rules",
          "Run a full UDP scan"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "ACK scanning (-sA) is specifically designed to map firewall rulesets and can help determine whether ports are filtered by stateful or stateless packet filtering, making it the most effective next step."
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "type": "multiple-choice",
        "question": "When scanning a large enterprise network, what is the most critical first step?",
        "options": [
          "Run an aggressive scan with version detection",
          "Perform comprehensive host discovery",
          "Execute NSE vulnerability scripts",
          "Start port scanning immediately"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Host discovery is crucial before detailed scanning of large networks. It helps identify active hosts, conserves resources, and prevents overwhelming the network with unnecessary scans of inactive hosts."
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "type": "multiple-choice",
        "question": "Your scan needs to evade IDS detection. Which combination would be least likely to trigger alerts?",
        "options": [
          "Decoy scanning with timing delays",
          "Fragment packets with source port manipulation",
          "Maximum speed scan with version detection",
          "Normal scan with NSE scripts"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Combining packet fragmentation with source port manipulation effectively evades many IDS systems. Fragmentation prevents pattern matching, while source port manipulation can bypass port-based rules."
      },
      {
        "id": 5,
        "type": "multiple-choice",
        "question": "During version detection (-sV), NMAP reports 'tcpwrapped' for several ports. What does this indicate?",
        "options": [
          "The ports are behind a firewall",
          "TCP Wrappers is controlling access",
          "The scan was blocked",
          "Version detection failed"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "The 'tcpwrapped' response specifically indicates that TCP Wrappers is controlling access to the service. This access control mechanism accepts connections but requires authentication before allowing service access."
