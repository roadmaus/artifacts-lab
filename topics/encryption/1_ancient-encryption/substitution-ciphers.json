          "The text is shifted 6 positions forward",
          "The text returns to its original form",

        "explanation": "Caesar cipher shifts are additive. Two shifts of 3 positions result in a total shift of 6 positions forward in the alphabet."

        "options": [
          "It is reciprocal - encoding and decoding use the same process",
          "It requires a numerical key",

          "It uses multiple alphabets"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "The Atbash cipher is special because it's reciprocal - applying the cipher twice returns the original text, and the same process is used for both encryption and decryption."
