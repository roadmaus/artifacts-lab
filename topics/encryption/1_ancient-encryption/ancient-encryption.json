          "Spartans",
          "Romans",
          "Persians",
          "Egyptians"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "The Spartans invented the scytale in the 5th century BCE for military communications. It consisted of a cylinder with a strip of parchment wrapped around it."

        "question": "What is the key characteristic of a monoalphabetic substitution cipher?",
        "options": [
          "Each letter is consistently replaced by the same substitute",
          "Multiple alphabets are used for encryption",
          "The message is written backwards",
          "Numbers replace letters"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "In a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, each letter in the plaintext is consistently replaced by the same letter in the ciphertext."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "The Vigenère cipher used a keyword to create multiple shift values, making it much harder to crack than single-shift ciphers."

        "question": "What made the Pigpen cipher unique?",
        "options": [
          "It used symbols instead of letters",
          "It could only encrypt numbers",
          "It required sunlight to decode",
          "It needed two people to operate"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "The Pigpen (or masonic) cipher replaced letters with symbolic representations based on their position in a grid, making it visually distinct from other methods."
