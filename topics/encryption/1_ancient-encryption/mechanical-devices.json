        "question": "What made the scytale unique among ancient encryption methods?",
        "options": [
          "It required a physical object for both encryption and decryption",
          "It used multiple alphabets",
          "It only worked with Greek letters",
          "It needed sunlight to operate"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "The scytale was unique because it required a physical rod of the exact same diameter for both encryption and decryption, making it one of the first encryption methods to rely on a physical tool."

          "It worked underwater"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "Alberti's cipher disk was revolutionary because it introduced the concept of changing encryption alphabets within a single message, leading to the development of polyalphabetic ciphers."
