        "type": "multiple-choice",
        "question": "What is the main characteristic of symmetric encryption?",
        "options": [
          "Uses the same key for encryption and decryption",
          "Uses different keys for encryption and decryption",

          "Only works for text data"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "Symmetric encryption uses the same secret key for both encrypting and decrypting data, which is why it's called 'symmetric'."
