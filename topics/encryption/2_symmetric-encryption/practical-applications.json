        "id": 2,
        "type": "multiple-choice",
        "question": "What is the main advantage of client-side encryption for cloud storage?",
        "options": [
          "The cloud provider never has access to unencrypted data",
          "It's faster than server-side encryption",

          "It's easier to implement"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "Client-side encryption ensures that data is encrypted before it reaches the cloud provider, meaning the provider never has access to the unencrypted data, providing true end-to-end encryption."
