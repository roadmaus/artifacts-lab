        "question": "Which property of hash functions ensures that it's computationally infeasible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash?",
        "options": [
          "Collision resistance",
          "Pre-image resistance",

          "Avalanche effect"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "Collision resistance ensures that finding two different inputs that hash to the same output is computationally infeasible, which is crucial for security applications."

        "id": 2,
        "type": "multiple-choice",
        "question": "Why is MD5 no longer recommended for security purposes?",
        "options": [
          "It's too slow",
          "Collisions can be found efficiently",
          "It produces too short outputs",
          "It uses too much memory"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "MD5 is cryptographically broken as researchers have demonstrated efficient methods to find collisions, making it unsuitable for security applications."
