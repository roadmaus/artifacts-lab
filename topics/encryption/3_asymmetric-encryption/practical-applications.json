          "To securely exchange the symmetric session key",

        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "In SSL/TLS, asymmetric encryption is primarily used during the handshake to securely exchange the symmetric session key. The actual data transmission uses symmetric encryption for better performance."

          "Private keys prove ownership and allow signing transactions",

        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "In cryptocurrencies, the private key proves ownership of funds and is used to sign transactions. The corresponding public key/address allows others to verify ownership and send funds."
