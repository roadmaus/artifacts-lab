        "correctAnswer": 3,
        "explanation": "TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) represent the highest level of the pyramid and are the most difficult for adversaries to change, as they require fundamentally altering their methodology."

        "question": "Why are Hash Values considered 'Trivial' in the Pyramid of Pain?",
        "options": [
          "They are not important for detection",
          "They are easy for attackers to modify",
          "They are difficult to collect",
          "They require special tools to generate"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Hash Values are considered trivial because attackers can easily modify them by making minor changes to their files, making them unreliable as long-term indicators."

          "File scanning"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "Behavior analytics is most effective for identifying TTPs as it focuses on patterns of behavior rather than specific indicators, making it harder for adversaries to evade detection."
