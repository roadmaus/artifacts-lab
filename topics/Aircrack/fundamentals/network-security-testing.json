      {
        "id": 1,
        "type": "multiple-choice",
        "question": "What is the primary purpose of monitor mode in wireless network testing?",
        "options": [
          "To connect to multiple networks simultaneously",
          "To capture all wireless packets regardless of destination",
          "To increase wireless signal strength",
          "To hide the testing device from detection"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Monitor mode allows a wireless interface to capture all wireless packets in range, regardless of their destination, which is essential for network analysis and testing."
      },

        "id": 2,
        "type": "multiple-choice",
        "question": "Which information is NOT typically included in wireless beacon frames?",
        "options": [
          "Connected client MAC addresses",
          "Network name (ESSID)",
          "Supported data rates",
          "Channel information"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "Beacon frames contain network configuration information like ESSID, encryption, data rates, and channel, but not the MAC addresses of connected clients."
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "type": "multiple-choice",
        "question": "What is the purpose of MAC filtering in wireless networks?",
        "options": [
          "To encrypt wireless traffic",
          "To boost signal strength",
          "To restrict network access based on device MAC addresses",
          "To compress network packets"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "MAC filtering is a security feature that restricts network access to only devices whose MAC addresses are on an approved list."
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "type": "multiple-choice",
        "question": "How often does an Access Point typically send beacon frames?",
        "options": [
          "About 10 times per second",
          "Once per minute",
          "Every 5 seconds",
          "Only when clients connect"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "Access Points broadcast beacon frames approximately 10 times per second to announce their presence and share network information."

        "id": 5,
        "type": "multiple-choice",
        "question": "In Open System Authentication, what happens after a client requests authentication?",
        "options": [
          "The AP immediately grants network access",
          "The client must provide encryption keys",
          "The AP authenticates and awaits association request",
          "The client must verify its identity"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "In Open System Authentication, the AP authenticates the client without requiring credentials, but the client must still request association before gaining network access."
