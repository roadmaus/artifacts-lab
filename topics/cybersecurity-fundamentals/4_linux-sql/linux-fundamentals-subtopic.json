            "The Linux Kernel serves as the core of the operating system, managing hardware resources, process scheduling, and memory management. It provides essential services through system calls and maintains security through privilege levels. Example: When a user program needs to read from disk, it must request this operation through the kernel via system calls.",
            "User Space vs. Kernel Space represents a critical security boundary in Linux. Kernel space has unrestricted hardware access and runs with elevated privileges, while user space is restricted and must request kernel services. This separation prevents malicious or buggy applications from compromising system stability. Example: A web browser runs in user space and must request network access through kernel system calls.",
            "The Linux Boot Process follows a specific sequence: BIOS/UEFI → Boot Loader (GRUB) → Kernel Loading → Init System (systemd) → User Space Services. Each stage performs crucial security checks and system initialization. Example: systemd manages system services, ensuring they start in the correct order and with appropriate permissions."

            "The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) defines the directory structure and content in Linux systems. Key directories serve specific purposes: /bin for essential commands, /etc for system configuration, /home for user data, /var for variable data. Example: System logs are stored in /var/log to separate them from static configuration files in /etc.",
            "Linux File Types include regular files, directories, symbolic links, block devices, character devices, and sockets. Each type has distinct properties and security implications. Example: Symbolic links can create flexible file organization but must be carefully managed to prevent security vulnerabilities.",
            "Mount Points and Storage Management in Linux allows flexible organization of storage devices. File systems can be mounted anywhere in the directory tree, with various options for security and performance. Example: Mounting /home on a separate partition provides better security and easier backup management."

            "Process States and Lifecycle in Linux include: Running, Sleeping (interruptible/uninterruptible), Stopped, and Zombie. The kernel scheduler manages process states and CPU allocation. Example: When a process waits for I/O, it enters a sleep state, allowing other processes to use the CPU.",
            "Process Hierarchy and Relationships form a tree structure where each process (except init) has a parent. Understanding this hierarchy is crucial for process management and security. Example: When a parent process terminates, its children are either adopted by init or terminated, preventing orphaned processes.",
            "Resource Control and Limitations are implemented through cgroups and ulimit. These mechanisms prevent resource exhaustion and ensure fair system usage. Example: Using cgroups to limit memory and CPU usage for containerized applications, preventing one container from impacting others."
