Scanner selection criteria includes: coverage requirements, accuracy rates, and integration capabilities. Implementation requires: proper scoping, credentials management, and scan scheduling.",
            "Scanning Methodology Framework includes: (1) Discovery Scans: identify active hosts and services (2) Port Scans: enumerate open ports and running services (3) Vulnerability Scans: identify specific vulnerabilities (4) Compliance Scans: check against security standards. Best practices include: scan windows coordination, business impact consideration, and proper authorization. Example: Weekly authenticated scans of internal networks with daily external perimeter scans.",
