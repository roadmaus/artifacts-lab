            "NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) consists of five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. Implementation tiers range from Partial (Tier 1) to Adaptive (Tier 4). Framework profiles help organizations move from current to target state. Example: A healthcare organization using CSF to structure their security program, mapping controls to HIPAA requirements and identifying gaps.",
            "ISO 27001 provides a systematic approach to information security through the Information Security Management System (ISMS). Key components include: Scope definition, risk assessment methodology, Statement of Applicability (SoA), and continuous improvement through the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle. Example: Financial institution implementing ISO 27001 to demonstrate robust security practices to clients and regulators.",
            "MITRE ATT&CK Framework maps adversary tactics and techniques, enabling organizations to assess security capabilities and gaps. The framework covers: Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Lateral Movement, Collection, Command and Control, Exfiltration, and Impact. Example: Using ATT&CK to evaluate security tools and develop threat hunting programs."

Examples include: Security policies, standard operating procedures (SOPs), personnel security policies, and change management procedures. Critical components: Clear documentation, regular reviews, enforcement mechanisms, and employee training programs. Example: Implementing a comprehensive acceptable use policy with annual certification requirements.",
            "Technical Controls utilize technology to protect assets and enforce security policies. Categories include: Preventive (firewalls, encryption), Detective (IDS/IPS, SIEM), Corrective (backup systems, patch management), and Compensating controls (alternative measures when primary controls aren't feasible). Example: Implementing multi-factor authentication with biometric and token-based factors to compensate for password vulnerabilities.",
            "Physical Controls protect tangible assets and computing resources. Key elements include: Access control systems, surveillance, environmental controls, and secure areas. Implementation considerations: Cost, effectiveness, regulatory requirements, and user impact. Example: Using mantraps, biometric access controls, and CCTV systems to protect data centers."

Implementation involves: Data mapping, privacy impact assessments, consent management, and breach notification procedures. Example: Implementing data subject access request (DSAR) processes with automated workflow and response tracking.",
            "PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) mandates security controls for payment card data. 12 requirements cover: Network security, encryption, access control, monitoring, testing, and security management. Critical processes: Cardholder data discovery, scope reduction, continuous monitoring, and quarterly vulnerability scanning. Example: Implementing network segmentation to isolate cardholder data environment and reduce PCI scope.",

Implementation requires: Control definition, documentation, testing, and independent auditor assessment. Key activities: Risk assessment, control mapping, evidence collection, and gap remediation. Example: Cloud service provider implementing SOC 2 controls to demonstrate security assurance to customers."
