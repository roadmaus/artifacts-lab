          "description": "The CIA triad represents the three fundamental objectives of information security: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. This framework serves as the foundation for developing security policies and evaluating security measures.",
          "points": [
            "Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information is only accessible to authorized parties. This involves encryption, access controls, and proper data classification. Examples include: protecting customer data, trade secrets, and intellectual property through mechanisms like encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access control (RBAC), and proper data handling procedures.",
            "Integrity maintains the accuracy and completeness of data throughout its lifecycle. This includes preventing unauthorized modifications and ensuring data consistency. Key mechanisms include: cryptographic hashing, digital signatures, checksums, and version control systems. For example, using SHA-256 for file integrity checking and implementing change control procedures.",
            "Availability ensures that systems and data are accessible when needed. This involves system redundancy, disaster recovery, and proper capacity planning. Examples include: implementing high-availability clusters, load balancers, backup systems, and adequate bandwidth provisioning to maintain 99.999% uptime for critical systems."

          "description": "Understanding the fundamental differences between proving identity (authentication) and granting access rights (authorization), and how they work together to secure systems.",
          "points": [
            "Authentication (AuthN) verifies the identity of users or systems through various factors: Something you know (passwords, PINs), Something you have (security tokens, smart cards), Something you are (biometrics). Modern systems often implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) combining multiple factors for stronger security.",
            "Authorization (AuthZ) determines what authenticated users can access or do within a system. This involves access control models like: Discretionary Access Control (DAC), Mandatory Access Control (MAC), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). Example: An employee might authenticate using their credentials and MFA, but their role determines which databases they can access.",
            "Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) dictates that users and processes should only have the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks. This reduces the attack surface and potential impact of compromised accounts. Example: A marketing employee shouldn't have access to HR databases, even if they can authenticate to the system."

          "points": [
            "Threats are potential dangers that could exploit vulnerabilities. Categories include: Natural (earthquakes, floods), Human (insider threats, hackers), and Environmental (power failures, HVAC issues). Understanding threat actors, their motivations (financial gain, espionage, hacktivism), and their capabilities is crucial for threat modeling.",
            "Vulnerabilities are weaknesses that can be exploited by threats. Types include: Technical (software bugs, misconfigurations), Physical (unsecured doors, exposed cables), and Human (lack of training, social engineering susceptibility). The CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) system provides standardized vulnerability identification.",
            "Risk is the potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability. Risk assessment involves: Identifying assets, threats, and vulnerabilities; Determining likelihood and impact; Calculating risk levels (Risk = Likelihood Ã— Impact). Example: A known SQL injection vulnerability (vulnerability) could be exploited by hackers (threat) to steal customer data, with a high likelihood and severe impact resulting in high risk."
