Key components include: Security steering committees, policy frameworks, and metrics for measuring security effectiveness. Example: Implementing NIST Cybersecurity Framework to structure security programs and measure maturity.",
            "Risk Management frameworks (ISO 31000, FAIR) provide structured approaches to identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks. Process includes: Risk identification, assessment, treatment, and monitoring. Example: Using quantitative risk analysis to determine potential financial impact of security breaches and prioritize security investments.",
            "Compliance Management ensures adherence to regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) and industry standards. Activities include: Regular audits, compliance monitoring, and maintaining documentation. Example: Implementing controls required by HIPAA for protecting healthcare data, including encryption and access logging."

            "Data Classification is crucial for determining appropriate security controls. Levels typically include: Public, Internal, Confidential, and Restricted. Each level requires specific handling procedures and controls. Example: Classified data requiring encryption both at rest and in transit, with strict access controls and audit logging.",
            "Asset Management involves maintaining inventories of all information assets, including: Hardware, software, data, and intellectual property. Critical activities include: Asset identification, ownership assignment, and lifecycle management. Example: Using CMDB (Configuration Management Database) to track all IT assets and their relationships.",
            "Data Privacy considerations include: Data minimization, purpose limitation, and data subject rights. Privacy by Design principles should be incorporated into all processes handling personal data. Example: Implementing data masking for development environments and ensuring proper data disposal methods."

Example: Implementing TLS 1.3 for secure communications and using HSMs (Hardware Security Modules) for key protection.",
            "Secure Architecture principles include: Defense in depth, segregation of duties, and fail-secure defaults. Network security components include: Firewalls, IDS/IPS, and VPNs. Example: Implementing a zero-trust architecture with micro-segmentation and continuous authentication."
