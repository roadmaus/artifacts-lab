            "TCP/IP Fundamentals and Security Risks: The TCP/IP protocol suite forms the foundation of modern network communications. Key security considerations include: SYN flood protection, TCP sequence prediction prevention, and IP spoofing countermeasures. Implementation example: Using SYN cookies to prevent SYN flood attacks by not allocating resources until connection completion verification.",
            "TCP Security Enhancements: Modern TCP implementations include several security features: TCP MD5 signatures for BGP sessions, TCP authentication option (TCP-AO) for improved security, and TCP selective acknowledgment (SACK) for performance. Best practice: Implement TCP authentication option for critical infrastructure communications to prevent session hijacking.",
            "IP Security Architecture (IPsec): IPsec provides end-to-end security at the network layer through: Authentication Header (AH) for integrity, Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) for confidentiality, and Internet Key Exchange (IKE) for key management. Example: Configuring IPsec tunnel mode for site-to-site VPN connections with AES-256 encryption and SHA-256 hashing."

Best practice: Configure TLS 1.3 with approved cipher suites and implement Certificate Authority Authorization (CAA) records.",

Implementation example: Setting up DMARC with p=reject policy and enabling STARTTLS enforcement for all email communications.",
            "DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC): DNSSEC protects against DNS spoofing through: Zone signing with public-key cryptography, Chain of trust verification, and Resource Record Digital Signatures (RRSIG).
