      {
        "id": 1,
        "type": "multiple-choice",
        "question": "Which network topology provides the highest level of redundancy?",
        "options": [
          "Bus topology",
          "Mesh topology",
          "Star topology",
          "Ring topology"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Mesh topology provides the highest redundancy by connecting each node to multiple other nodes, ensuring multiple paths for data transmission and reducing single points of failure."
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "type": "multiple-choice",
        "question": "What is the primary security advantage of network segmentation?",
        "options": [
          "Increased network speed",
          "Better data backup options",
          "Containment of security breaches",
          "Reduced power consumption"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "Network segmentation helps contain security breaches by limiting an attacker's ability to move laterally through the network, effectively isolating compromised segments."
      },

        "type": "multiple-choice",
        "question": "Which feature of TLS provides protection against man-in-the-middle attacks?",
        "options": [
          "Certificate validation",
          "Data compression",
          "Session resumption",
          "Keepalive messages"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "Certificate validation in TLS helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks by verifying the identity of the server through digital certificates and trusted certificate authorities."

        "id": 4,
        "type": "multiple-choice",
        "question": "In a defense-in-depth strategy, where should a DMZ be placed?",
        "options": [
          "Between internal networks",
          "Behind the internal firewall",
          "Between external and internal networks",
          "Within the internal network"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "A DMZ should be placed between external and internal networks to create a buffer zone for public-facing services while protecting internal resources."
      },
      {
        "id": 5,
        "type": "multiple-choice",
        "question": "What is the main purpose of NAT in network security?",
        "options": [
          "Encrypt network traffic",
          "Hide internal IP addresses",
          "Speed up network connections",
          "Filter malicious packets"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Network Address Translation (NAT) primarily helps security by hiding internal IP addresses from external networks, making it harder for attackers to map internal network structure."
