            "Local Area Networks (LANs): Modern LAN architectures incorporate multiple security layers: Physical security controls, network access control (802.1X), and traffic segmentation. Design considerations include: Scalability requirements, redundancy needs, and security zoning. Example: Implementing a hierarchical three-tier network design with core, distribution, and access layers, using VLANs for logical segmentation and spanning tree protocol for loop prevention.",
            "Wide Area Networks (WANs): Enterprise WAN connectivity requires robust security: SD-WAN security features, encryption requirements, and secure routing protocols. Critical components include: MPLS services, site-to-site VPNs, and QoS mechanisms. Best practice: Implementing redundant WAN links with automatic failover, using IPsec tunnels with strong encryption for all inter-site traffic.",
            "Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs): MANs connect multiple sites within geographic regions: Carrier ethernet services, dark fiber implementations, and wireless backhaul options. Security focus includes: Layer 2 security controls, encryption requirements, and physical path diversity. Example: Deploying carrier ethernet with MAC security (MACSec) encryption and redundant paths for critical sites."

Example: Implementing comprehensive security at each layer, from physical cable locks to application-layer encryption.",
            "Data Encapsulation Process: Secure data encapsulation involves multiple protection mechanisms: Header encryption options, payload protection, and protocol security features. Security considerations include: Protocol header protection, traffic analysis prevention, and secure encapsulation methods. Best practice: Using authenticated encryption modes (like AES-GCM) for data protection while maintaining performance.",
            "Error Detection and Recovery: Reliable data transmission requires: Cyclic redundancy checks (CRC), forward error correction (FEC), and automatic repeat request (ARQ) mechanisms. Implementation includes: Error detection codes, retransmission protocols, and quality monitoring. Example: Configuring BER thresholds and FEC on fiber optic links while monitoring for potential security incidents."

Implementation includes: DSCP marking, queuing strategies, and bandwidth reservation. Example: Implementing hierarchical QoS policies to prioritize critical security traffic while preventing resource exhaustion attacks.",
            "Latency Optimization: Network latency management involves: Path optimization, protocol tuning, and performance monitoring. Key considerations include: Round-trip time (RTT) monitoring, jitter control, and buffer management. Best practice: Using performance routing (PfR) with security-aware path selection to optimize both performance and security.",
            "High Availability Design: Resilient networks require: Redundant components, failover mechanisms, and disaster recovery capabilities. Implementation includes: Device redundancy, link aggregation, and automated failover configurations. Example: Deploying HSRP with BFD for fast failure detection while maintaining security policy consistency across redundant devices."
