            "TCP vs UDP Considerations: TCP provides better performance for most modern networks, especially over WAN or unreliable connections. TCP handles network congestion better and supports larger transfer sizes (up to 1MB compared to UDP's 32KB limit). Key configuration: 'mount -o tcp' enables TCP transport. TCP is mandatory for NFSv4 but optional for v2/v3.",
            "Network Buffer Tuning: Socket buffer sizes significantly impact performance. Adjust via sysctl parameters: net.core.rmem_max, net.core.wmem_max for maximum buffer sizes, and net.ipv4.tcp_rmem, net.ipv4.tcp_wmem for TCP-specific tuning. Example values for 10GbE: 'net.core.rmem_max = 16777216' and 'net.core.wmem_max = 16777216'.",
            "MTU and Network Interface Settings: Proper MTU configuration prevents fragmentation issues. For jumbo frames, ensure consistent MTU settings across client, server, and network infrastructure. Enable flow control on network interfaces: 'ethtool -A eth0 rx on tx on'. Monitor network errors using 'netstat -s' to identify fragmentation or congestion issues.",
            "Connection Multiplexing: NFSv4 reduces network overhead by multiplexing operations over a single connection. Earlier versions require separate connections for different services (mount, lock, status). Configure sufficient connection tracking in firewalls: 'nf_conntrack_max' and related parameters when using stateful packet inspection."

            "Read/Write Buffer Sizes: Optimize rsize/wsize mount options based on workload and network characteristics. Modern networks benefit from larger sizes (e.g., 'rsize=262144,wsize=262144'). However, larger sizes may degrade performance on unreliable networks due to retransmission overhead. Monitor performance using 'nfsstat -c' to determine optimal values.",
            "Cache Tuning Strategies: Balance cache consistency vs performance through mount options. 'actimeo' sets overall cache timeout, while 'acregmin/acregmax' provide fine-grained control. For heavily shared files, reduce cache times or use 'noac'. For read-mostly workloads, increase cache duration: 'acregmax=600,acregmin=60'.",
            "Directory Entry Caching: Control directory entry caching through 'acdirmin/acdirmax' options. Longer cache times improve ls performance but may delay visibility of changes. For dynamic directories, use shorter times: 'acdirmin=30,acdirmax=300'. Monitor cache effectiveness using 'nfsstat' directory operation statistics.",
            "Storage Layout: Optimize server's storage configuration for NFS workload. Use separate physical devices for NFS data and metadata/journals. Enable write-back caching on RAID controllers but ensure battery backup. XFS or ext4 with properly tuned journal locations provide good NFS server performance."

Example: For high-concurrency workloads on modern hardware, start with 'thread_count = 8 * cpu_cores'. Adjust based on monitoring data.",
            "Memory Management: Configure vm.dirty_ratio and vm.dirty_background_ratio for write-heavy workloads. Lower values reduce memory pressure but may impact write performance. Example settings for NFS server: 'vm.dirty_ratio=20' and 'vm.dirty_background_ratio=10'. Monitor dirty pages using '/proc/vmstat'.",

Set using: 'echo scheduler_name > /sys/block/device/queue/scheduler'. Monitor I/O patterns with 'iostat -x' to validate scheduler choice.",
