            "ESTALE Errors: Occurs when accessing stale file handles, typically caused by file deletion, export changes, or server-side modifications. Resolution steps include: 1) Verify file existence and export status, 2) Check for recent file system changes or renames, 3) Consider enabling/disabling subtree checking. Common cause: Replacing files while they're in use by clients can trigger ESTALE errors.",
            "Permission Denied Errors: Can stem from multiple sources: 1) Incorrect export options ('rw' vs 'ro'), 2) Root squashing settings, 3) File system permissions, or 4) SELinux/AppArmor restrictions. Example troubleshooting: Check /var/log/audit/audit.log for SELinux denials, verify effective UID mapping with 'id' command, and review export options with 'exportfs -v'.",
            "Server Not Responding: Common triggers include: 1) Network connectivity issues, 2) Firewall rules blocking NFS ports, 3) NFS service failures, or 4) Server overload. Diagnostic approach: Use 'rpcinfo -p' to verify RPC services, 'tcpdump' to check network traffic, and 'showmount -e' to verify exports. Key investigation: Check system logs for resource exhaustion or service failures.",
            "Mount Point Issues: Problems include: 1) 'mount.nfs: access denied' due to export restrictions, 2) 'No such device' from missing kernel modules, or 3) 'Operation not permitted' from insufficient privileges. Resolution workflow: Verify kernel NFS support with 'lsmod', check mount point permissions, and confirm export visibility using 'showmount'."

          "points": [
            "Network Diagnostics: Essential tools include: 1) 'tcpdump' for packet analysis (e.g., 'tcpdump -i any port 2049'), 2) 'nfsstat' for NFS statistics and operation counts, 3) 'netstat' for connection status. Advanced usage: Combine 'tcpdump' with 'wireshark' for detailed protocol analysis. Example filter: 'port 2049 or port 111' captures both NFS and portmapper traffic.",
            "Server-side Monitoring: Key monitoring points: 1) '/proc/net/rpc/nfsd' for server thread utilization, 2) 'exportfs -v' for export status, 3) 'rpcinfo' for RPC service verification. Performance analysis: Use 'iostat', 'vmstat', and 'dstat' to correlate NFS issues with system resource usage. Monitor file handle usage with '/proc/sys/fs/file-nr'.",
            "Client Diagnostics: Critical tools: 1) 'mount' command with '-v' option for verbose output, 2) '/proc/mounts' for actual mount options, 3) 'strace' for system call tracing. Debugging strategy: Use 'strace -f -e trace=network mount -t nfs' to trace mount problems. Monitor client caching with '/proc/fs/nfs/content'.",
            "Lock Management Tools: Troubleshoot locking with: 1) 'lslocks' to view current file locks, 2) 'sm-notify' for lock recovery testing, 3) '/var/lib/nfs/statd' for NSM state examination. Recovery procedure: Use 'rm -f /var/lib/nfs/state' and restart services to reset lock state in case of corruption."

Recovery sequence: First attempt normal unmount, escalate to force unmount, then use lazy unmount only if necessary. Important: Document process state before killing for post-mortem analysis.",
            "Server Recovery: Service restoration steps: 1) Verify file system integrity with fsck before re-export, 2) Clear stale locks using 'rpc.statd --no-notify', 3) Re-establish exports with 'exportfs -ra'. Critical consideration: Check for active clients before restart using 'showmount -a'. Implement graduated recovery to minimize client impact.",
            "Network Problem Resolution: Address network issues through: 1) MTU size adjustment for fragmentation problems, 2) Socket buffer tuning for performance issues, 3) Connection tracking cleanup for firewall-related problems. Example: Reset connection tracking with 'echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/flush' for stuck connections.",
            "Data Consistency Recovery: Handle cache coherency issues by: 1) Using 'sync' command to flush buffers, 2) Implementing 'noac' mount option temporarily, 3) Verifying file timestamps across clients. Recovery validation: Use 'rsync -n' to detect inconsistencies without making changes. Important: Create file system snapshots before major recovery operations."
